# brevity
*A better way to manage productivity and keep track of your tasks.*

## Inspiration
As a student, I have a lot of stuff to do, from schoolwork to extracurriculars and family events. That's why I use applications like Todoist and Google Calendar (both of which heavily inspired brevity, including its UI!). However, these lack one thing - the ability to see what tasks I do when, and my productivity levels for each day. That's exactly why I created brevity.

## What it does
On top of the normal functions of a todo application (creating tasks, due dates, etc.), brevity also keeps track of how long you do each task for, offering helpful visualizations to see how productive you were every day.

## How I built it
I used the MERN web stack with Material UI, Tailwindcss, and more.

## Challenges I ran into
A big challenge was time - I wanted to add way too many features in way too less time, causing me to not be able to do all of them and rush at the end.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Creating this product! I love the UI I made and that I was able to get this much of the project finished in such a short amount of time.

## What I learned
I learned a lot about new APIs in JavaScript and how to program a website in a short period of time.

## What's next for brevity
In the future, I want to add many more visualizations, especially one to track habits, as that is something I (and I'm sure many others) would really appreciate to be able to track easily.
